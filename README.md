# project-todo-list

Using the knowledge and practice of OOP so far in The Odin Project, create a to-do-list web application that will store data locally.

### The application must be able to do the following:

1. Create a new item to add to list.
2. Be able to add the following information to each item.
   a. Title
   b. Description
   c. Due date
   d. Priority
3. Create a new list (project) and be able to determine which item will live in which list (project).
4. Be able to delete a list or item.
5. Be able to edit an existing item.
6. Default (home page) that shows all items to be completed.

### Extra objectives:

1. Have a list (project) for items due today / tomorrow / this week.
2. Sorting feature (by date / by priority)
